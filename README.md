to write a program to handle the scout team's camping equipment loan. The
system tracks camping equipment loans. The system checks the level of the
user, and depending on the level of the user, the system determines whether
such a loan is allowed. The system also tracks the loan history. For the
convenience of the user, the system allows the administrator to insert text files
in a specified format for bulk data insertion. Data insertion is the insertion of a
batch of users and the insertion of a batch of camping equipment. The system
can use the user ID and password as admin and admin to save the default
administrator ID
